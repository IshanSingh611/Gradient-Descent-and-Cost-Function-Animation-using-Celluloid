# Gradient-Descent-and-Cost-Function-Animation-using-Celluloid
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost. Gradient descent is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically (e.g. using linear algebra) and must be searched for by an optimized algorithm.

Gradient descent is the most popular optimization strategy used in Machine Learning & Deep Learning right now.


#### Steps for Gradient Descent
- Our goal is to find a best fit line for given points
- Start by random initialization of coeff and intercept
- Calculate error between actual y and predicted y
- Calculate partial derivatives of coeff and intercept in each iteration
- Update new coeff & intercept with learning rate and gradient descent
- Repeat until satisfactory result in achieved
